        Once a day, Ego Eater runs an algorithm to pair the hotties of the world. The last person
        just lost interest in you. But fret not. There are many things you can do. (1) Rank more
        users to find the special one who\'s into you. (2) Text your matches faster. Once you sent
        the first message, the match becomes locked. (3) This is the hardest yet most satisfying.
        Become more attractive. Hit the gym. Get new clothes. Put a smile on your face by following
        your passion.
