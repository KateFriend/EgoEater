    <!-- About Activity -->
    <string name="about_app_heading">About Ego Eater App</string>
    <string name="about_app_body_text">
        Ego Eater is an Android app for online dating. You compare two profiles and pick the one you
        like better. With enough comparison picks, the app will create a ranking from whom you like
        the most to least.\n
        \n
        Next the app limits every user to maximum 10 matches. Matches are made based on whom you
        like the most and who likes you back. If you both are super popular, chances are you\'ll get
        matched up unless either of you runs out of matches. If you are more average attractive,
        chances are that your top choices will run out of matches before you\'d even get considered.
        You\'ll likely end up matching with other average attractive people who couldn\'t get their
        first choices.\n
        \n
        There is of course the chance that you and your hottie are a niche. Say you are both super
        into punk. You might like each other back as number one while the world doesn\'t care about
        you two.

    <string name="about_background_heading">Background</string>
    <string name="about_background_body_text">
        We\'ve all been in group situations, e.g. a class or summer camp. After a little while, the
        group develops an understanding of who gets paired up with who. Jenny, the runner, goes
        with Fred, also a runner. James always watches indie flicks. He\'ll end up with April
        because she does the same.\n
        \n
        When we get to a big  city with a big dating pool, we suddenly see the creme of the crop.
        Some of us won\'t settle for anything less and keep chasing unattainable "gods" and
        "goddesses." Ego Eater slots you with only a small number of matches that you actually have
        a chance with.\n
        \n
        Avoid wasting time by sending hundreds of messages to girls that never message you back.
        Avoid getting your inbox flooded by thousands of messages. Get focused right on a hand
        selected number of people that are your high value matches.

        Once a day, Ego Eater runs an algorithm to pair the hotties of the world. The last person
        just lost interest in you. But fret not. There are many things you can do. (1) Rank more
        users to find the special one who\'s into you. (2) Text your matches faster. Once you sent
        the first message, the match becomes locked. (3) This is the hardest yet most satisfying.
        Become more attractive. Hit the gym. Get new clothes. Put a smile on your face by following
        your passion.
